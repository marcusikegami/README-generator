## Description 

This app uses Node.js and NPM's inquirer package in order to generate a professional-quality README.md file using command line prompts. The program also generates a LICENSE.txt file and adds a 'License' section to the readme if the user chooses to license their software with one of the licenses included in this app.

## Installation

**Make sure you have Node.js installed before continuing with these installation steps.** First, clone the repository to a directory of your choice (possibly the directory of your current project in need of a readme), then navigate to the README-generator directory you have just created in a CLI. Next, in the command line, run the command "npm install" to install all required npm dependencies and the inquirer package (inquirer is essential for this application to work!). Finally, run the command "Node index.js" in the root directory of README-generator in order to run the application. If you see the first prompt "? Enter the project title (required):", the application is running correctly with all necessary files installed. If not see that you have installed Node.js correctly and you reside in the README-generator directory in your CLI. Fill out the prompts as you see fit and upon answering all prompts a README.md and/or a LICENSE.txt file should have been created in the root directory of README-generator.

## Usage

Fill out the prompts as you see fit and upon answering all prompts a README.md and/or a LICENSE.txt file should have been created in the root directory of README-generator.
